# The effect of age and gender on Titanic survival rate 

Titanic is the most damaging cruise ship disaster in human history with more than 1,500 deaths out of 2,224 passengers aboard on April 10, 
1912.  With data for this accident from ​Kaggle​, this reports will explore a plausible age range of survivors and non-survivors. A statistical and practical significance test is also carried out to determine whether females who survived tended to be younger than females who did not survive.
The aim is to examine the notion that survivors of Titanic are younger than non-survivors, and if this notion can 
apply to the female population.

# Data set

Out of three Kaggle-provided datasets available, this report will focus on exploring the dataset train.csv 
which provides ground truth of 891 passengers in the Titanic with variables such as age, ticket class, survival outcome, etc. <br/>The data can be found ​here​.
